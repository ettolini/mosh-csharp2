Interfaces

-   The name of interfaces are prefixed with "I".
-   Their methods don't have bodies.
-   They define the capability a class should provide.
-   Classes that use interfaces don't know about the classes that implement their methods, they only care about the interface they reference.
-   You can't inherit more than one class, but you can implement multiple interfaces
-   If a class is declared to be implementing an interface, it indeed must have an implementation to every method declarated in the interface.

        if (order.TotalPrice < 30f)
            return order.TotalPrice * 0.1;
        
        return 0;
