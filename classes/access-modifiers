Access Modifiers
They are a way to control access to a class and/or its members.
Used to create safety in out programs, to achieve a proper Encapsulation.

-   Public

-   Private

-   Protected

Private fields should start with an underline ( _ ) and be typed using the camelCase.
Private fields are hidden from the outside, can only be accessed through methods. Like the getters and setters.

public class Person
{
    private string _name;

    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
            this._name = name;
    }

    public string GetName()
    {
        return _name;
    }
}

Encapsulation concepts dictates that objects should only reveal what they can do, not how they do it.
