Fields (like attributes)

They are variables that we declare at the class level, used to store data about the class.
Some developers believe we only need to create constructors when we need to initialize fields based on values that come from the outside.

Read-only Fields

Using the readonly modifier, we can make sure the field's value is only assigned once, to secure our code's data.

public class Customer
{
    readonly List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
}
