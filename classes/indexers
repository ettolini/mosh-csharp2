Indexers may not be something you use everyday, but they can be an useful tool.

var cookie = new HttpCookie();
cookie.Expire = DateTime.Today.AddDays(5);

Using indexers      ->  cookie["name"] = "Mosh";
                        var name = cookie["name"];

Not using indexers  ->  cookie.SetItem("name", "Mosh");
                        var name = cookie.GetItem("name");

You can declare indexers as if they were properties

public class HttpCookie
{
    public string this[string key]  // In this case, my indexer is a string, declared as "key".
    {
        get { ... }
        set { ... }
    }
}

If your indexers' values are numeric, you should use a list. If they're strings, dictionaries are a better option.
