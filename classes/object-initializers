Object Initializers allow you to initialize an object without the need to call or define a constructor for the needed signature.

var person = new Person
                {
                    FirstName = "Mosh",
                    LastName = "Hamedani"
                };

What happens is, the default Person constructor is called, and then the atributtes called in the initializer are given the specified values.
This is a useful tool, you can make sure to only define the specific constructors you will truly need. The rest can be handled this way.
