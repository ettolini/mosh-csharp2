-   Stack: Where primitive values are stored.
-   Heap: Where reference values are stored.

-   Boxing
The process of converting a value type instance to an object reference.

int number = 10;
object obj = number;

// or
object obj = 10;

// What happens behind the scenes is that the 10 value is stored in the heap, instead of the stack

-   Unboxing
Is the opposite of boxing, casting a value to a primitive type so it's stored in the stack.

object obj = 10;
int number = (int)obj;

-   Boxing / Unboxing both have a performance penalty, since they have an "extra object creation".
