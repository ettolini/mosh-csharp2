Convertion from a base class to a derived class.

Circle circle = new Circle();
Shape shape = circle;

Circle anotherCircle = (Circle)shape;   // We explicitly get a new Circle Object

Car car = (Car)shape;   // Throws InvalidCastException, we can prevent it with the As Keyword

-   The As Keyword

Car car = (Car)obj; // It might throw an exception

Car car = obj as Car;   // If failed, doesn't throw an exception. It'd return null
if (car != null)
{ ... }

-   The Is Keyword

if (obj is Car) // This way you can make sure you know what you're working with before acting
{
    Car car = (Car)obj;
    ...
}
