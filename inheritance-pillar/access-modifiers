Access Modifiers

-   Public: Accessible from everywhere.

-   Private: Accessible only from the class.

-   Protected: Accessible only from the class and its derived classes (considered a bad practice).
    If you need to use it, it's ok. But do prefer private methods over protected ones.

-   Internal: Accessible only from the same assembly (namespace). It doesn't work in another assembly that references the internal one.

-   Protected Internal: Accessible only from the same assembly or any derived classes (takes too much brain power to understand/use).

ACCESSING TIP:
If you want to access classes from a different name space, you should type "using 'nameSpace's name'" at the beggining of your code.
And every class you access, you need to reference their nameSpace first. Example: Space.Class.Method();
