What is Inheritance?

-   A kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to inherit code from the other.
-   They have a "Is-A" relationship. Example: A Car is a Vehicle (Car inherits from Vehicle).

Benefits

-   Code re-use.
-   Polymorphic behaviour.

Syntax

    // The Parent / Base / Super class

    {
        // Common shared code
    }

    // The Child / Derived / Sub class 
    public class Text : PresentationObject
    {
        // Code specific to Text
    }
